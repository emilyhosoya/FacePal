# FacePal

We combine a facial recognition API called Kairos with a payments API, Stripe.

The purpose of using facial recognition is to make payments more secure by verifying the identity of the person initiating the transaction.

We used Kairos to gather data on a user based on their photo, and cross-check it with any available information on file, such as a userâ€™s age. If the data matches, then the user is able to successfully complete a payment.
